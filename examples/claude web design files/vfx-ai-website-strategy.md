## 📝 SAMPLE CONTENT OUTLINES

### Sample 1: Research Paper

**Title:** "Multi-Modal Shot Complexity Classification for VFX Production Estimation"

**Abstract:**
VFX production estimation suffers from 40-60% variance between quoted and actual costs, primarily due to subjective shot complexity assessment. We present a multi-modal classification system combining computer vision (shot frames), natural language processing (shot descriptions), and structured metadata (technical specs) to predict complexity tier and labor hours with 82% accuracy across 500 production shots.

**Sections:**
1. Introduction & Motivation
2. Related Work (industry practices + academic ML)
3. Dataset Construction (how we labeled 500 shots)
4. Methodology (model architecture, training)
5. Results (accuracy, ablation studies)
6. Production Integration (how this would deploy)
7. Limitations & Future Work
8. Conclusion

**Assets:**
- GitHub repo with code
- Downloadable dataset (anonymized)
- Interactive model demo
- Jupyter notebook walkthrough

---

### Sample 2: Analysis Piece

**Title:** "Why Every VFX Studio's AI Strategy Looks the Same (And Why That's Failing)"

**Outline:**
- **Opening:** Observation that every studio presentation shows the same 3 demos
- **Thesis:** Industry is stuck in "technology push" vs "problem pull"
- **Evidence:** 
  - Survey of 20 studio AI initiatives
  - Common patterns: rotoscoping, upscaling, style transfer
  - Adoption rates: <10% actually in production
- **Analysis:**
  - Why demos don't translate to workflows
  - The "QC problem" nobody solves
  - Artist resistance roots
- **Way Forward:**
  - Start with pipeline problems, not AI capabilities
  - Build quality gates first
  - Measure time-to-value, not technical metrics
- **Conclusion:** The studios that succeed will be those who build boring infrastructure

**Visuals:**
- Chart: AI initiatives vs production adoption
- Comparison table: Demo metrics vs production requirements
- Workflow diagram: Where AI actually helps

---

### Sample 3: Tool Review

**Title:** "Runway Gen-3 for VFX Production: A 60-Day Reality Check"

**Outline:**
- **Overview:** What Runway promises
- **Test Methodology:** 
  - 50 real production scenarios
  - 3 different shot types
  - Measured against traditional methods
- **Performance:**
  - Quality assessment (side-by-side)
  - Speed/cost comparison
  - Reliability/consistency
- **Production Integration:**
  - Workflow compatibility
  - Artist learning curve
  - Technical requirements
- **Verdict:**
  - Where it excels (creative exploration, previs)
  - Where it fails (shot-matched final)
  - ROI calculation
- **Alternatives:** Brief comparison to competitors
- **Recommendation:** Use cases where worth adopting

**Scoring:**
```
Overall: 7.5/10
Quality: 8/10
Speed: 9/10
Production-Ready: 6/10
Value: 8/10
```

## 🎓 WRITING STYLE GUIDE

### Voice & Tone

**Authoritative but Accessible**
- Like an industry veteran explaining to a smart colleague
- Not academic stuffiness
- Not breathless tech hype
- Confident in expertise, humble about limitations

**Example of Good Tone:**
> "After testing five AI rotoscoping tools on 100 production shots, one thing became clear: the demos lie. Not intentionally—but there's a massive gap between controlled test footage and the chaos of real production plates with motion blur, bad lighting, and hair that seems designed to break algorithms."

**Example of Bad Tone:**
> "Our revolutionary methodology leverages cutting-edge deep learning to disrupt traditional VFX workflows..."

### Writing Principles

1. **Lead with the problem, not the solution**
   - Bad: "We built an ML model..."
   - Good: "VFX supervisors waste 6 hours per episode on estimation..."

2. **Use concrete numbers**
   - Bad: "Significantly reduced costs"
   - Good: "Reduced estimation time from 6 hours to 45 minutes"

3. **Show, don't just tell**
   - Include before/after examples
   - Embed visualizations
   - Link to working demos

4. **Acknowledge limitations**
   - Every piece should include what didn't work
   - Discuss edge cases
   - Be honest about generalizability

5. **Bridge technical and strategic**
   - Explain how the technical choice affects business outcome
   - Connect ML metrics to production KPIs
